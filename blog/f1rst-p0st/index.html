While I love this approach, I knew that it would come back haunt me if (when) I wanted to change site-wide layouts or theming. For that reason, I wanted to switch over to a static site generator.<p>In a mix of not-in-house syndrome and overconfidence, I started by writing <a href=https://github.com/pbone64/wobsite/>my own SSG</a>. While this was a fun learning excercise and (given infinite time) a polished version of it would have been perfect for my needs, it turns out that making an ergonomic and powerful templating language takes <em>a lot</em> of work.<p>With my reality sufficiently checked, I set out on a search.<p>I eventually decided on Zola for a couple of reasons:<ul><li>it's a CLI tool, so I don't have to set up a Node.js environment for my static site.<li>it's written in Rust, so I can understand & modify it's code.<li>it provides nifty features, such as the syntax highlighting (seen below) and local serving & reloading to speed up writing.</ul><pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust style=background:#000;color:#cdd6f4><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span style=color:#cba6f7>fn </span><span style=font-style:italic;color:#89b4fa>main</span><span style=color:#9399b2>() {

</span></code></pre><p>So far, I'm happy with this choice & I recommend Zola to anyone else looking for a clean & simple SSG. Now I just need a half-finished project to write about...<p><a href=https://pbone.dev/blog/>..return to /blog/</a></body><footer><p class=weak>website and content licensed under <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.
