I migrated this website to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

<!-- more -->

Previously, it was handmade html files. While I love this approach, I knew that it would come back haunt me if (when) I wanted to change site-wide layouts or theming. For that reason, I wanted to switch over to a static site generator.

In a mix of not-in-house syndrome and overconfidence, I started by writing [my own SSG](https://github.com/pbone64/wobsite/). While this was a fun learning excercise and (given infinite time) a polished version of it would have been perfect for my needs, it turns out that making an ergonomic and powerful templating language takes _a lot_ of work.

With my reality sufficiently checked, I set out on a search.

I eventually decided on Zola for a couple of reasons:
- it's a CLI tool, so I don't have to set up a Node.js environment for my static site.
- it's written in Rust, so I can understand & modify it's code.
- it provides nifty features, such as the syntax highlighting (seen below) and local serving & reloading to speed up writing.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

So far, I'm happy with this choice & I recommend Zola to anyone else looking for a clean & simple SSG. Now I just need a half-finished project to write about...
